*** WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things ***

2019.01.23 - version 2.1.5
* Fix - Child Bundle/Composite cart item prices not aggregated when: 1) choosing the one-off option; and 2) the container product has a blank base/static price.
* Fix - Fatal error when adding carts to subscriptions under WC 3.5+.

2018.11.01 - version 2.1.4
* Fix - Unable to add products without subscription schemes to existing subscriptions, due to a regression in 2.1.3. Sorted.

2018.11.01 - version 2.1.3
* Fix - When trying to add a product with subscription schemes to an existing subscription, the matching subscriptions list in single-product pages did not always refresh correctly when the chosen scheme changed. The period of the active scheme had to change to trigger a refresh. This is now fixed.

2018.10.25 - version 2.1.2
* Fix - Ensure the add-to-cart form action is cleared only when switching. Resolves an issue with External product links not functioning as expected.

* Fix - Default variable product subscription scheme not pre-selected in chosen variation details.
* Fix - Preserve variation details when adding to subscription. Affected variations with "free" attribute values.
* Fix - Failure to re-subscribe to subscriptions containing subscription-schemed products added via flows other than the regular/checkout one, e.g. manually or via the REST API.

2018.06.07 - version 2.1.1

* Fix - When adding a new scheme to a Variable product, some Price fields appear mislabelled.

2018.05.03 - version 2.1.0

Notes: 1) Feature must enabled under 'WooCommerce > Settings > Subscriptions > Add to Subscription > Products'. 2) Prorated subscription schemes are not supported.
* Feature - It's now possible to add entire carts with subscription options to existing subscriptions. When viewing a cart with subscription options, customers can load a list of active subscriptions matching the billing schedule of the chosen subscription option, and add the contents of their cart to an active subscription. Notes: 1) Feature must enabled under 'WooCommerce > Settings > Subscriptions > Add to Subscription > Carts'. 2) Prorated subscription schemes are not supported.
* Fix - Streamlined management of Bundles and Composites in subscriptions. It is no longer possible to remove individual child/container line items - removals are delegated to the container item.
